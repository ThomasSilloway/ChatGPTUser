Uses the web version of ChatGPT

This whole thing is super hacky, could be made to be way more robust

## How to use

Launch chrome with `Launch_Chrome.bat`

Navigate to ai.com, log in, and start a chat

run test_chrome_existing_window.py

It only seems to work if the chrome window is maximized btw.
